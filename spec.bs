Introduction {#intro}
=====================
<em>This section is not normative.</em>

In order to prevent cross-site user tracking, browsers are partitioning all forms of storage by top-frame site; see [=Client-Side Storage Partitioning=]. But, there are many [=legitimate use cases=] currently relying on unpartitioned storage.

This document introduces a new storage API that is intentionally not partitioned by top-frame site (though still partitioned by context origin), in order to serve a number of the use cases needing unpartitioned storage. To limit cross-site reidentification of users, data in Shared Storage may only be read in a restricted environment, such as in a [=fenced frame=] or via the [=private aggregation|private aggregation service=]. Over time, there may be additional ouput gates included in the standard.

<div class="example">
  `a.example` randomly assigns users to groups in a way that is consistent cross-site.

  Inside an `a.example` iframe:
  <pre class="lang-js">
    function generateSeed() { … }
    await window.sharedStorage.worklet.addModule('experiment.js');

    // Only write a cross-site seed to a.example's storage if there isn't one yet.
    window.sharedStorage.set('seed', generateSeed(), { ignoreIfPresent: true });

    let fencedFrameConfig = await window.sharedStorage.selectURL(
      'select-url-for-experiment',
      [
        {url: "blob:https://a.example/123…", reportingMetadata: {"click": "https://report.example/1..."}},
        {url: "blob:https://b.example/abc…", reportingMetadata: {"click": "https://report.example/a..."}},
        {url: "blob:https://c.example/789…"}
      ],
      { data: { name: 'experimentA' } }
    );

    // Assumes that the fenced frame 'my-fenced-frame' has already been attached.
    document.getElementById('my-fenced-frame').config = fencedFrameConfig;
  </pre>

  inside the `experiment.js` worklet script:
  <pre class="lang-js">
    class SelectURLOperation {
      hash(experimentName, seed) { … }

      async run(data, urls) {
        const seed = await this.sharedStorage.get('seed');
        return hash(data.name, seed) % urls.length;
      }
    }
    register('select-url-for-experiment', SelectURLOperation);
  </pre>
</div>

The {{SharedStorageWorklet}} Interface {#worklet}
=================================================
The {{SharedStorageWorklet}} object allows developers to supply [=module scripts=] to process [=Shared Storage=] data and then output the result through one or more of the output gates. Currently there are two output gates, the [=private aggregation=] output gate and the {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()|URL-selection}} output gate.

<xmp class='idl'>
  [Exposed=(Window)]
  interface SharedStorageWorklet : Worklet {
  };
</xmp>

  ## The {{SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope}} ## {#global-scope}

  The {{SharedStorageWorklet}}'s [=worklet global scope type=] is {{SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope}}. 

  <xmp class='idl'>
    [Exposed=SharedStorageWorklet, Global=SharedStorageWorklet]
    interface SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope : WorkletGlobalScope {
      undefined register(DOMString name,
                         SharedStorageOperationConstructor operationCtor);
    };

    callback SharedStorageOperationConstructor =
      SharedStorageOperation(optional SharedStorageRunOperationMethodOptions options);

    [Exposed=SharedStorageWorklet]
    interface SharedStorageOperation {
    };

    dictionary SharedStorageRunOperationMethodOptions {
      object data;
      boolean resolveToConfig = false;
      boolean keepAlive = false;
    };
  </xmp>

  Each {{SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope}} has an associated [=environment settings object=] <dfn for=SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope>outside settings</dfn>, which is the associated {{SharedStorageWorklet}}'s [=relevant settings object=].

  The {{SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope}}'s [=module map=]'s [=module scripts=] should each define and {{register}} one or more {{SharedStorageOperation}}s. 

  Each {{SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope}} also has an associated <dfn for=SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope>operation map</dfn>, which is a [=map=], initially empty, of [=strings=] (denoting operation names) to [=functions=].

  Currently each {{SharedStorageOperation}} registered via {{SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope/register()}} must be one of the following two types:
  * {{SharedStorageRunOperation}}
  * {{SharedStorageSelectURLOperation}}

  The {{SharedStorageRunOperation}} is designed to work with output gates that do not need a return value, like the [=private aggregation=] service. A {{SharedStorageRunOperation}} performs an async operation and returns a promise that resolves to undefined.

  A {{SharedStorageSelectURLOperation}} is an {{SharedStorageOperation}} that takes in a [=list=] of {{SharedStorageUrlWithMetadata}}s (i.e. [=dictionaries=] containing [=strings=] representing {{URL}}s each wrapped with metadata), performs an async operation, and then returns a promise to a {{long}} integer index specifying which of these {{URL}}s should be selected.

  <xmp class='idl'>
    [Exposed=SharedStorageWorklet]
    interface SharedStorageRunOperation : SharedStorageOperation {
      Promise<undefined> run(object data);
    };

    [Exposed=SharedStorageWorklet]
    interface SharedStorageSelectURLOperation : SharedStorageOperation {
      Promise<long> run(object data,
                        FrozenArray<SharedStorageUrlWithMetadata> urls);
    };

    dictionary SharedStorageUrlWithMetadata {
      USVString url;
      object reportingMetadata;
    };
  </xmp>

  ## Registering a Worklet ## {#register-worklet}
  <div algorithm>
    The <dfn method for="SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope">register(|name|, |operationCtor|)</dfn> method steps are:

    1. If |name| is missing or empty, throw a {{TypeError}}.
    1. Let |operationMap| be this {{SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope}}'s [=SharedStorageWorkletGlobalScope/operation map=].
    1. If |operationMap| [=map/contains=] an [=map/entry=] with [=map/key=] |name|, throw a {{TypeError}}.
    1. If |operationCtor| is missing, throw a {{TypeError}}.
    1. If the result of running [=IsConstructor()=] with |operationCtor| is false, throw a {{TypeError}}.
    1. Let |prototype| be the result of running |operationCtor|'s [=object/[[GetPrototypeOf]]()=] method.
    1. If |prototype| is not an [=object=], throw a {{TypeError}}.
    1. Let |run| be the result of running [=GetMethod()=] with |prototype| and "`run`".
    1. If |run| is undefined, throw a {{TypeError}}.
    1. [=map/Set=] the value of |operationMap|[|name|] to |run|.
  </div>

Shared Storage's Backend {#backend}
===================================
The Shared Storage API will integrate into the [=Storage Model|Storage API=] as below, via [=storage endpoint/registering=] a new [=storage endpoint=].

  ## Monkey Patch for the [=Storage Model=] ## {#monkey-patch}

  This standard will add a new [=storage type=] "`shared`" to the [=Storage Model=].

  A [=user agent=] holds a [=shared storage shed=] for [=storage endpoints=] of [=storage type|type=] "`shared`".

  This standard will also [=storage endpoint/register=] a [=storage endpoint=] of [=storage type|type=] "`shared`" with [=storage identifier=] "`sharedStorage`" and [=storage endpoint/quota=] `5`<sup>`4`</sup> `*` `2`<sup>`16`</sup> bytes (i.e. 39.0625 mebibytes).

  <span class=todo>This [=storage endpoint/quota=] is calculated from the current implementation. Consider bringing the current implementation in line with the spec for [=storage endpoints=] "`localStorage`" and "`sessionStorage`", i.e. `5 * 2`<sup>`20`</sup> bytes. For example, decreasing the per-origin entry limit from 10,000 to 1,280 would achieve this.</span>

  A <dfn>shared storage shed</dfn> is a [=map=] of [=/origins=] to [=storage shelf|storage shelves=]. It is initially empty.

  Note: Unlike [=storage sheds=], whose keys are [=storage keys=], [=shared storage sheds=] use [=/origins=] as keys directly. [=Shared storage=] will be intentionally excluded from [=client-side storage partitioning=].

  For each [=storage shelf=] in a [=shared storage shed=], the [=storage shelf=]'s [=bucket map=] currently has only a single key of "`default`".

  A [=user agent=]'s [=shared storage shed=] holds all <dfn>shared storage</dfn> data.

  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn>obtain a shared storage shelf</dfn>, given a [=shared storage shed=] |shed| and an [=environment settings object=] |environment|, run these steps:

    1. Let |origin| be |environment|'s [=url/origin=].
    1. If |origin| is an [=opaque origin=], then return failure.
    1. If the user has disabled [=shared storage=], then return failure.
    1. If |shed|[origin] does not exist, then set |shed|[origin] to the result of running [=create a shared storage shelf=] with [=storage type|type=] "`shared`".
    1. Return |shed|[|origin|].
  </div>

  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn>create a shared storage shelf</dfn>, run these steps:

    1. Let |shelf| be a new [=storage shelf=].
    1. Set |shelf|'s [=bucket map=]["`default`"] to the result of running [=create a shared storage bucket=].
    1. Return |shelf|.
  </div>

  A <dfn>shared storage bucket</dfn> is a [=storage bucket=] in one of a [=shared storage shed=]'s [=storage shelf|shelves=].

  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn>create a shared storage bucket</dfn>, run these steps:

    1. Let |endpoint| be the [=storage endpoint=] with [=storage identifier=] "`sharedStorage`".
    1. Let |bucket| be a new [=shared storage bucket=].
    1. Set |bucket|'s [=bottle map=]["`sharedStorage`"] to a new [=storage bottle=] whose [=storage bottle/quota=] is |endpoint|'s [=storage endpoint/quota=].
    1. Return |bucket|.
  </div>

  Note: Currently, a [=shared storage bucket=]'s [=bottle map=] has [=map/size=] `1`, since there is only one [=storage endpoint=] [=storage endpoint/registered=] with [=storage type|type=] "`shared`".

  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn>obtain a shared storage bottle map</dfn>, given an [=environment settings object=] |environment|, run these steps:

    1. Let |shed| be the [=user agent=]'s [=shared storage shed=].
    1. Let |shelf| be the result of running [=obtain a shared storage shelf=] with |shed| and |environment|.
    1. If |shelf| is failure, then return failure.
    1. Let |bucket| be |shelf|'s [=bucket map=]["`default`"].
    1. Let |bottle| be |bucket|'s [=bottle map=]["`sharedStorage`"].
    1. Let |proxyMap| be a new [=storage proxy map=] whose [=backing map=] is |bottle|'s [=map=].
    1. [=set/Append=] |proxyMap| to |bottle|'s [=proxy map reference set=].
    1. Return |proxyMap|.
  </div>

  ## The [=Shared Storage Database=] ## {#database}

  A [=/browsing context=] has an associated <dfn>shared storage database</dfn>, which provides methods to [=shared storage database/store an entry in the database|store=], [=shared storage database/retrieve an entry from the database|retrieve=], [=shared storage database/delete an entry from the database|delete=], [=shared storage database/clear all entries in the database|clear=], and [=shared storage database/purge expired entries from the database|purge expired=] data, and additional methods as below. The data in the [=shared storage database|database=] take the form of [=shared storage database/entry|entries=].

  Each [=shared storage database=] has a <dfn for="shared storage database">shared storage database queue</dfn>, which is the result of [=start a new parallel queue|starting a new parallel queue=], on which the each of the [=shared storage database=]'s methods run when calls to them are initiated from that [=/browsing context=].

  Each <dfn for="shared storage database">entry</dfn> consists of a [=entry/key=] and a [=entry/value struct=].

  An [=shared storage database/entry=]'s <dfn for=entry>key</dfn> is a [=string=].

  [=User agents=] may specify the <dfn for=key>maximum length</dfn> of a [=entry/key=].

  Since [=entry/keys=] are used to organize and efficiently retrieve [=shared storage database/entry|entries=], [=entry/keys=] must appear at most once in any given [=shared storage database=].

  An [=shared storage database/entry=]'s <dfn for=entry>value struct</dfn> is a [=struct=] composed of [=string=] <dfn for="value struct">value</dfn> and {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} <dfn for="value struct">last updated</dfn> (from the [=Unix Epoch=]).

  [=User agents=] may specify the <dfn for=value>maximum length</dfn> of a [=value struct/value=].

  [=User agents=] may specify a <dfn>default entry lifetime</dfn>, the default [=duration=] between when an [=shared storage database/entry=] is [=shared storage database/store an entry in the database|stored=] and when it expires. If the [=user agent=] specifies a [=default entry lifetime=], then it should have a timer periodically [=shared storage database/purge expired entries from the database=].

  ## The [=Shared Storage Database|Database=] Algorithms ## {#database-algorithms}

  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn for="shared storage database">store an entry in the database</dfn>, given a [=shared storage database/shared storage database queue=] |queue|, an [=environment settings object=] |environment|, a [=entry/key=] |key|, and a [=value struct/value=] |value|, run the following steps on |queue|:

    1. Let |valueStruct| be a new [=entry/value struct=].
    1. Set |valueStruct|'s [=value struct/value=] to |value|.
    1. Let |currentTime| be the [=current wall time=].
    1. Set |valueStruct|'s [=value struct/last updated=] to |currentTime|.
    1. [=map/Set=] |databaseMap|[|key|] to |valueStruct|.
    1. Return true.
  </div>

The {{SharedStorage}} Interface {#shared-storage-interface}
==========================================================
The {{SharedStorage}} interface is the base for derived interfaces {{WindowSharedStorage}} and {{WorkletSharedStorage}}, which are exposed to the {{Window}} and the {{SharedStorageWorklet}}, respectively.

Methods that allow the setting and/or deleting of data are exposed to both the {{Window}} and the {{SharedStorageWorklet}} and hence are declared in the base {{SharedStorage}} interface, although their implementations may vary depending on their [=environment=]. This makes it possible to modify the data in Shared Storage from multiple contexts.

Meanwhile, methods for running {{SharedStorageOperation}}s, along with the {{WindowSharedStorage/worklet}} attribute which is used to call {{Worklet/addModule()}}, are declared in {{WindowSharedStorage}} and exposed to the {{Window}} only, as these are the means by which the {{Window}} interacts with the {{SharedStorageWorklet}}.

On the other hand, methods for getting data from the [=shared storage database=] are declared in {{WorkletSharedStorage}} and exposed to the {{SharedStorageWorklet}} only, in order to carefully control the flow of data read from the [=shared storage database|database=].

<xmp class='idl'>
  [Exposed=(Window,SharedStorageWorklet)]
  interface SharedStorage {
    Promise<any> set(DOMString key,
                     DOMString value,
                     optional SharedStorageSetMethodOptions options = {});
    Promise<any> append(DOMString key,
                        DOMString value);
    Promise<any> delete(DOMString key);
    Promise<any> clear();
  };

  dictionary SharedStorageSetMethodOptions {
    boolean ignoreIfPresent = false;
  };
</xmp>

  ## The {{WindowSharedStorage}} interface ## {#window}

  The {{WindowSharedStorage}} interface is as follows.

<xmp class='idl'>
  [Exposed=(Window)]
  interface WindowSharedStorage : SharedStorage {
    Promise<any> run(DOMString name,
                     optional SharedStorageRunOperationMethodOptions options = {});
    Promise<FencedFrameConfig> selectURL(DOMString name,
                                 FrozenArray<SharedStorageUrlWithMetadata> urls,
                                 optional SharedStorageRunOperationMethodOptions options = {});

  ### Entropy Budget ### {#budget}

  Because [=bits of entropy=] can leak via {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}} if a user activates the fenced frame from the resulting {{FencedFrameConfig}}, there is a per-[=calling origin=] [=entropy allowance=].

  A <dfn>calling origin</dfn> for {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}} is the [=url/origin=] of an [=environment=] that makes a {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}} call.

  A <dfn>entropy allowance</dfn> is a maximum allowance of [=entropy bits=] that are permitted to leak during a given [=budget epoch=] and for a given calling [=calling origin=]. This [=entropy allowance|allowance=] is defined by the [=user agent=] and is [=calling origin=]-agnostic.

  A [=user agent=] will define a fixed predetermined [=duration=] <dfn>budget lifetime</dfn>.

  An <dfn>budget epoch</dfn> is any interval of time whose [=duration=] is the [=budget lifetime=].

  To keep track of how this [=entropy allowance=] is used, the [=user agent=] uses a <dfn>shared storage budget table</dfn>, which is a [=map=] of [=calling origins=] to [=entropy ledgers=].

  An <dfn>entropy ledger</dfn> is a [=list=] of [=bit debits=].

  A <dfn>bit debit</dfn> is a [=struct=] containing a {{double}} <dfn for="bit debit">bits</dfn>, indicating a value in [=entropy bits=], along with a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} <dfn for="bit debit">timestamp</dfn> (from the [=Unix Epoch=]).

  [=Bit debits=] whose [=bit debit/timestamps=] precede the start of the current [=budget epoch=] are said to be <dfn for="bit debit">expired</dfn>.

  When a leak occurs, its value in [=entropy bits=] is calculated and stored for that [=calling origin=], along with the current time as a [=bit debit/timestamp=], together as a [=bit debit=] in the [=shared storage budget table=].

  A [=calling origin=]'s <dfn for="calling origin">remaining budget</dfn> is the [=entropy allowance=] minus any [=bit debits=] whose [=bit debit/timestamps=] are within the current [=budget epoch=].

  {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}}'s argument "`urls`" is its <dfn for=selectURL>input URL list</dfn>.

  When an [=calling origin=] has insufficient [=calling origin/remaining budget=], {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}} will return a {{FencedFrameConfig}} for the {{SharedStorageUrlWithMetadata/url}} in the {{SharedStorageUrlWithMetadata}} at the [=default index=] in its [=selectURL/input URL list=].

  The <dfn>default index</dfn> for a call to {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}} is implementation-defined in such a way that it is independent from the result of the associated {{SharedStorageSelectURLOperation}}'s "`run`" method.

  <div class="example">
    The [=default index=] could be defined to be 0.

    In this case, whenever the {{SharedStorageSelectURLOperation}}'s "`run`" method encounters an error, or whenever there is insufficient [=calling origin/remaining budget=], the "`run`" method would return 0, and hence {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}} would return the first {{SharedStorageUrlWithMetadata/url}} in its [=selectURL/input URL list=].
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    The [=default index=] could be defined to be [=selectURL/input URL list=]'s [=list/size=] minus 1.

    In this case, whenever the {{SharedStorageSelectURLOperation}}'s "`run`" method encounters an error, or whenever there is insufficient [=calling origin/remaining budget=], {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}} would return the last {{SharedStorageUrlWithMetadata/url}} in its [=selectURL/input URL list=].
  </div>

  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn>determine remaining budget</dfn>, given a calling [=calling origin=] |origin|, run the following steps:

    1. If |origin| is [=opaque origin|opaque=], return undefined.
    1. Let |maxBits| be the value of the [=user agent=]'s [=entropy allowance=].
    1. If the [=user agent=]'s [=shared storage budget table=] does not [=map/contain=] |origin|, then return |maxBits|.
    1. Otherwise, let |ledger| be [=user agent=]'s [=shared storage budget table=][|origin|].
    1. Let |debitSum| be 0.
    1. For each [=list/item=] |bitDebit| in |ledger|, do the following steps:
        1. Let |debit| be |bitDebit|'s [=bit debit/bits=].
        1. If the result of running [=check whether a bit debit is expired=] with |bitDebit| is false, then increment |debitSum| by |debit|.
    1. Return |maxBits| minus |debitSum|.
  </div>

  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn>check whether a bit debit is expired</dfn>, given a [=bit debit=] |bitDebit|, run the following steps:

    1. Let |epochLength| be [=budget lifetime=].
    1. Let |currentTime| be the [=current wall time=].
    1. Let |threshold| be |currentTime| minus |epochLength|.
    1. If |bitDebit|'s [=bit debit/timestamp=] is less than |threshold|, return true.
    1. Otherwise, return false.
  </div>


  A [=bit debit=] will need to be charged to the [=shared storage budget table=] for each top-frame navigation initiated by a fenced frame whose source was generated via {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}}, as this can leak cross-site data. Since the [=bit debit/bits=] to charge is calculated during the call to {{WindowSharedStorage/selectURL()}} but only actually recorded in the [=shared storage budget table=] if and when the resulting fenced frame initiates a top-frame navigation, the [=bit debit/bits=] must be stored as a <dfn>pending shared storage budget debit</dfn> in the corresponding {{FencedFrameConfig}} until this time.

  Between [=beginning navigation=] and [=ending navigation=], a [=user agent=] will perform the [=charge shared storage budget=] algorithm.

  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn>charge shared storage budget</dfn> during a [=beginning navigation|navigation=] with [=navigable=] |navigable| and {{Document}} |sourceDocument|, run the following steps:

    1. If |navigable| is not a [=navigable/traversable navigable=], return.
    1. Let |node| be |sourceDocument|'s [=node navigable=].
    1. While |node| is not null:
        1. If |node| has a {{FencedFrameConfig}}:
            1. Let |origin| be |node|'s [=active document=]'s [=document/origin=].
            1. Let |pendingBits| be |node|'s {{FencedFrameConfig}}'s [=pending shared storage budget debit=].
            1. If |pendingBits| is greater than 0, run the following steps:
                1. Let |ledger| be [=user agent=]'s [=shared storage budget table=][|origin|].
                1. Let |bitDebit| be a new [=bit debit=].
                1. Set |bitDebit|'s [=bit debit/bits=] to |pendingBits|.
                1. Let |currentTime| be the [=current wall time=].
                1. Set |bitDebit|'s [=bit debit/timestamp=] to |currentTime|.
                1. [=list/Append=] |bitDebit| to |ledger|.
                1. Set |node|'s {{FencedFrameConfig}}'s [=pending shared storage budget debit=] to 0.
        1. Set |node| to |node|'s [=navigable/parent=].
  </div>

  A [=user agent=] may wish to set a timer to periodically [=purge expired bit debits from all entropy ledgers=], as the [=bit debit/expired=] [=bit debits=] will no longer be needed.
  <div algorithm>
    To <dfn>purge expired bit debits from all entropy ledgers</dfn>, run the following steps:

    1. For each <var ignore="">origin</var> -> |ledger| of [=user agent=]'s [=shared storage budget table=]:
        1. For each |bitDebit| in |ledger|:
            1. If the result of running [=check whether a bit debit is expired=] with |bitDebit| is true, [=list/remove=] |bitDebit| from |ledger|.
